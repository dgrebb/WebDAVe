# AWS ECS EFS WebDAV Server

A [`dave`](https://github.com/micromata/dave) Docker setup for AWS Elastic Container Service, as well as Terraform to provision infrastructure.

## Getting Started

* clone the repo

### Set up `dave` and the `Dockerfile`

* rename `server/config.example.yaml` üëâ `config.yaml`
* adjust the values to your liking
* create certificates for TLS by following the `dave` [README](server/README.md) or comment out the `tls` section
* use the `dave` cli to generate passwords for `server/config.example.yaml` running `cd server && go run cmd/davecli/main.go passwd`
  * you may need to [install `go`](https://go.dev/doc/install) first
* adjust paths in `server/Dockerfile` to suit your needs
* the `RUN chown -R` step is important for AWS to allow `dave` permission to create files and allow WebDAV methods

### Configure Terraform

I use [`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/) to manage secrets and inject them when running Docker and Terraform commands. You can set this up yourself, or set the values in plaintext in the `tf/scripts/set-tf-vars.example.sh` script.

* rename `tf/scripts/set-tf-vars.example.sh` üëâ `set-tf-vars.sh`
  * ensure this file is executable by running `chmod a+x tf/scripts/set-tf-vars.sh`
* use whatever domain/subdomain your heart desires
  * *note*: at the time of writing, this setup requires a subdomain
* run `make tfi` to initialize Terraform

### Configure `Makefile`

* As with Terraform, secrets are injected via `pass` by default. You can set up `pass`, or set the variables at the top of `Makefile` in plaintext.

## Deploying to AWS üöÄ

First, we need to set up the ECR repository. We'll run `make tfpr` to provision the repo, then `make db` (`docker build`) to build the image, and finally `make dp` to push the image up to ECR. See the steps below.

**Important**: Note that the `Makefile` uses `docker buildx build` and a target architecture of `linux/amd64`. This builds Docker images for AWS ECS on M1/M2 Macs, which default to building with the Apple silicon ARM architecture.

### Provision the ECR Repository

* if you haven't already, run `make tfi` to initialize Terraform
* run `make tfa` to provision your infrastructure
  * **note**: the first run will yield no ECS Cluster tasks ‚Äî because the ECR repository is currently empty... we'll fix that in the next section

### Build and push the Docker image

* run `make db`, which will build the Docker image and name the target what is specified in the `IMAGE_NAME` variable at the top of `Makefile`
* run `make dp`, which will login to AWS, tag the image with build time and  "`latest`", and push it to ECR
* check the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories) to ensure your image has been pushed
  * be sure you are in the region specified in `Makefile` and `tf/scripts/set-tf-vars.sh`

### Provision the Infrastructure

* modify `tf/modules/cluster/cluster.tf` as such:
  * uncomment [lines 30-33](https://github.com/dgrebb/aws-ecs-efs-webdav-server/blob/main/tf/modules/cluster/cluster.tf#L30)
    * this section will pull the latest image digest
  * comment [line 39](https://github.com/dgrebb/aws-ecs-efs-webdav-server/blob/main/tf/modules/cluster/cluster.tf#L39)
  * uncomment [line 41](https://github.com/dgrebb/aws-ecs-efs-webdav-server/blob/main/tf/modules/cluster/cluster.tf#L41)
    * this will attach the latest image digest to your ECS Cluster Task Definition, which will recreate the resource any time a new version of the image is found
* run `make tfi` once more if you've changed anything since the first steps in this README
* run `make tfp` to check what actions Terraform will be performing
* run `make tfa`
* when prompted, type `yes`, and hit "Enter/Return"
* celebrate

*Note*: As this is a WebDAV server, there is nothing to open in the browser. You can check if your users/passwords are working by going to `https://subdomain.example.net`, but the browser won't know what to do after you authenticate.

Connectivity can be checked in macos by using Finder:

* open a Finder window
* hit **cmd+k**
* type `https://subdomain.example.com` and click "Connect"
* you will be prompted for user/pass (these are what was set up in `server/config/config.yaml`)

## Useful Commands

The [`Makefile`](Makefile) includes useful short commands that apply the project variables you've set in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.
